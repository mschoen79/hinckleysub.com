## About

This is the layout design document for an N scale model railroad based on the **BNSF Hinckley Subdivision** (ex-Great Northern) and **DM&IR ore operations** in Minnesota's Arrowhead Region. The layout covers ~155 prototype miles compressed into 12 modular sections with continuous running.

## What's Inside

- **Prototype History** — The railroads of Minnesota's Arrowhead, from James J. Hill to BNSF
- **Track Schematic** — Full layout overview with 12 modules, double-track sections, and reverse loops
- **Detailed Track Plans** — Every module with track arrangements, turnout counts, and operational notes
- **Rolling Stock Reference** — Car types and commodities by location
- **Operations Guide** — Six operator jobs, continuous BNSF circuit, session flow
- **Build Plan** — Module construction sequence from simple to complex
- **Locomotive & Rolling Stock Roster** — Recommended N scale purchases by manufacturer

## Layout Specs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Scale** | N (1:160) |
| **Track** | Micro Engineering Code 55, #6 turnouts |
| **Turnouts** | ~90 total |
| **Modules** | 12 (9 scenic + 2 hidden reverse loops + 1 hidden staging) |
| **Control** | Digitrax DCC, JMRI automation |
| **Operators** | 2–6 people |

## Three Railroads, One Layout

1. **BNSF mainline** — Manifest trains, unit trains, the Hinckley Local, and UP/CPKC trackage rights
2. **DM&IR ore railroad** — Taconite from the Iron Range to Lake Superior docks via Proctor's hilltop yard
3. **Amtrak** — North Star (historical) or Northern Lights Express (proposed)
